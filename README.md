### Project Description: K-Means Clustering for Traveler Segmentation

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment travelers into distinct groups based on their travel behavior and spending patterns. Using customer data such as booking preferences, average spending, and trip frequency, the analysis identifies five unique traveler profiles: 

1. **Business Travelers**  
2. **Moderate Families**  
3. **Frequent Adventurers**  
4. **Occasional Budget Travelers**  
5. **Solo and Occasional Travelers**  

The results provide actionable insights for tailoring marketing strategies and offering personalized perks, such as free checked luggage, exclusive discounts, or family-friendly deals.

The repository includes:

- **Colab Notebook:** The full K-Means implementation in Python, with data preprocessing, clustering analysis, and visualization.
- **Data Summary:** Key statistics and findings from the clustering process.
- **Interactive Google Colab Notebook:** Easily runnable for reproducing results.
- **Key Insights and Recommendations:** Business implications for each traveler segment.

This project demonstrates the practical application of unsupervised machine learning in enhancing customer segmentation and improving service personalization.
